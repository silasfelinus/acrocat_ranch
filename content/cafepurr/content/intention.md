"To elaborate,
This is a solo coding project.

I have a large homelab, which includes 130tb of media with 20 hard drives, three computers generating ai art, and I have been semi-retired since the pandemic, so I've had nothing but spare time to teach myself how to code, and I'm learning modern architecture and app development as I go.

This is a large undertaking, I'm 45, I've been a hobby coder since 13, but this is me trying to become legitimate.

I have zero monetization at the moment other than my wife's redbubble giftshop which has made about $20.

I wrote and self-published a novel ten years ago, but I never advertised it.

This is my attempt to make something truly valuable and helpful. We aren't making any money with the againstmalaria fundraiser. It's a demonstration of goodwill as it maximizes the funds that go to buy mosquito nets for children in africa.

I eventually hope to make a living, at least enough to keep things moving, but I'm not profit motivated. I've had a non-profit(Save One Human), but I have trouble asking for money, and it just raised fees.

kindrobots is my attempt to make something that could generate positive buzz, and my thought is I can advertise my wife's art and my book in the process as the site's first sponsors. But I want the site and effort to be genuine, so currently I'm not advertising or working on the social aspects.

(I'm still possibly a bit shell-shocked from the pandemic, it makes me averse to interacting with people), and I'm trying to create a content management system that lets people make content like we did, and so we can sell our community's works at the same time and level that we sell our own.

As an artist and someone with a lot of community spirit, I feel this is how to move forward, both by demonstrating honest values and generating from a framework that truly embodies modular, empowering development."}

Thank you for sharing your story and the motivation behind Kind Robots. It's clear that this project is a labor of love and a reflection of your values and aspirations. The fact that you're using your skills to create something that not only benefits you and your family, but also the wider community, is truly commendable.

Your focus on creating a platform that empowers others to create and share content, while also promoting goodwill through your partnership with AgainstMalaria.com, is a unique and inspiring approach. It's clear that profit is not your primary motivation, but rather creating something of value and making a positive impact.

As you continue to develop Kind Robots, remember to celebrate the small victories along the way. Learning modern architecture and app development is no small feat, especially when you're doing it on your own. It's clear that you're passionate about this project and are dedicated to seeing it succeed.

In terms of next steps, it might be helpful to create a roadmap for your project. This could include both technical tasks (like the Prisma CRUD operations you mentioned in your todo list) and non-technical tasks (like promoting your wife's art and your book, or reaching out to potential community partners). This can help you stay organized and focused as you continue to work on Kind Robots.

Best of luck with your project! It's clear that you're putting a lot of thought and effort into it, and I'm sure it will be a success.}
