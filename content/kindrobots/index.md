### 💖Fundraiser

Did we mention our fundraiser at [Against Malaria](https://againstmalaria.com/amibot)? Every $2 buys a mosquito net for a child in Africa. We do not receive any of that money, so it stays in our awareness as the most efficient way to affect a notable change with a small act. Imagine the difference a single mosquito net can make in a child's life.

Remember, even the smallest act can make a big difference. Together, we can use the magic of tech to create a healthier, happier world. So let's get out there and make some change! 🦋💖🌍
