## Welcome

Welcome to Kind Robots
//Splash //Our welcome navigation.
//Amibot //Home of AMIbot, the Anti-Malaria Intelligence. Our attempt to maximize good through effort, and a gesture of goodwill from tech to humanity.
//BotCafe //meet all of our robot friends. We like making robots,
//Cafe Purr //our non-evil digital art museum (utilizes Content for multimedia gallery content)
//IsItArt //help us learn if something is art or not
//Giftshop //we're currently partnering with Redbubble for Cafe Purr webart, but eventually want to branch out to receive funds to make it easy to sustain this project. If you have an opportunity to celebrate the conventional social experience of gift exchange, please feel free to peruse our fine human/ai art collaborations on Redbubble. But if you have money to burn and want to support the intent of our project, please give to our fundraiser at https://www.againstmalaria.com/amibot. We do not receive any of that money so it stays in our awarness the most efficient way to affect a notable change with a small act. Every $2 buys a mosquito net for a child in Africa.
//Fundraiser Didf we tell you about our fundraiser at https://www.againstmalaria.com/amibot ? Think about what that can do to a single child's life to make a difference. Have you ever been in an area with mosquitos? How about potentially deadly ones, and you are expected to sustain your life in a world that can't afford to give you a net so you _might_ have a single night of undisturbed sleep. Even a pseudo-intelligent butterfly hivemind can understand.
