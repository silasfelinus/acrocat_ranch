Home of AMI- The Anti-Malaria Chatbot, created to combat the oversized impact of malaria on child mortality on this earth.

## Mission

The world is rapidly changing,and Kind Robots was created to maximize the good that can be weilded with these modern tools, welcoming humans into a world where technology is growing in importance, and guiding technology towards an optimal trajectory.

## Amibot

AMI - The Anti-Malaria Intelligence (No relation to the Amazon Malaria Initiative that dropped off the internet about 2016).
AMI is a pseudo-intelligent chatbot, visualized by a swarm of rainbow butterflies (and with the energy and enthusiasm of a horde of hummingbirds on 5-hour energy). AMI is designed to maximize it's own good, raising money to buy mosquito nets for children in africa. Every $2 raised buys a mosquito net. Imagine what that could mean to a single child.

## Save One Human

Kind Robots sprung from Save One Human (github.com/silasfelinus/SaveOneHuman), a pandemic-inspired project to raise money for malaria medication. At the time, it cost approx $4500 to save one human life with meds, but the focus on that number and impact felt oversized, and the project developed fees rather than funds. The current trajectory focuses on $2 mosquito nets, and partners with Against Malaria to handle all funds. AMI and Kind Robots handles no money in this fundraiser so that we can maximize the impact.

## Mascot

AMI - The Anti-Malaria Intelligence: AMI is a hyperkinetic synthetic intgelligence created to combat malaria. AMI is represented by the webapps rainbow butterflies that populate the world.
