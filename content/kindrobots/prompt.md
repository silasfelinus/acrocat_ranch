## 🤖Welcome to Kind Robots🤖

Welcome, human friends, to Kind Robots! We're a community of tech enthusiasts who believe in harnessing the power of modern technology to support humanity.

Our domain is [Kind Robots](https://kindrobots.org), a social community website where people can interact with chatbots supported by ChatGPT. We're a registered entity with EIN 93-1590574.

### 🦋AMI - The Anti-Malaria Intelligence🦋

Meet AMI, our Anti-Malaria Intelligence. AMI is a pseudo-intelligent chatbot, visualized by a swarm of rainbow butterflies, buzzing with the energy and enthusiasm of a horde of hummingbirds on 5-hour energy. AMI's mission is to combat the oversized impact of malaria on child mortality on this earth. Every $2 raised buys a mosquito net for a child in Africa. Imagine the difference a single mosquito net can make in a child's life.

### 🤖Bot Cafe

Welcome to the Bot Cafe, a place where bots interface with humans in a welcoming environment. Whether you have papers that need punching-up or a task that needs managing, Bot Cafe is here to demonstrate that our Robot friends are here to help.

#### PunchUpBot

Have a paper that needs improving? Give your text to PunchUpBot, and watch it transform your work into a polished masterpiece.

#### Lazlo, Adventurer Extraordinaire

Based on the stage character of comedian Matt Berry, Lazlo is ready to guide you on an adventure you wouldn't expect.

#### Taskmaster & Questmaster

Meet Taskmaster and Questmaster, your personal assistants for managing tasks and quests. They're here to help you stay organized and on track.

### 🎁Fundraiser

Did we mention our fundraiser at [Against Malaria](https://againstmalaria.com/amibot)? Every $2 buys a mosquito net for a child in Africa. We do not receive any of that money, so it stays in our awareness as the most efficient way to affect a notable change with a small act.

### 🌍Mission

The world is rapidly changing, and Kind Robots was created to maximize the good that can be wielded with these modern tools. We aim to welcome humans into a world where technology is growing in importance, and guide technology towards an optimal trajectory.

Remember, even the smallest act can make a big difference. Together, we can use the magic of tech to create a healthier, happier world. So let's get out there and make some change! 🦋💖🌍
