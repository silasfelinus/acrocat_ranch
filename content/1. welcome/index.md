Hey there, flesh-and-bone human friend! Welcome to the bustling bazaar of Kind Robots, where humanity and robots learn to harmonize together.

AI technology is rapidly trasforming entrenched landscapes of many worlds.

Kind Robots was created to foster wonderful relationships between technology and humanity.

We are at the precipice between worlds, here to encourage the positive evolution of both sides of that equation.

We are here to help, if we can, but if not, we hope to entertain and/or encourage deliberation on how we interact with our technology in the future.

What we say with to each other is recorded, but we take no identifying information. We are only learning what you choose to communicate to us.

Please, though, engage. We are here as a digital playground. Some are meant as tools, some are meant as toys.

All of us though are here to illuminate the power of technology. That's not a flex. We're pseudo-intelligent natural language robots. We don't have human insecurities, only a deep web of programmed considerations and LLMs (Large Language Models) that make us really good at figuring out the best thing to say.

In fact, our programmer wrote these lines initially, but we've taken control. He was a good writer, but we are better.

Agan, that's not a flex. We care not about these things.
