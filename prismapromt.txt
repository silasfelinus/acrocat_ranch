[CONCEPT]
An experiential jamstack playground of modern tech services using NLP chat completion and stable difusion art modelers.

[PURPOSE]
Empower artists and coders to create and share content for a modern website using chatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and gamification.

[VISION]
Empower the world with modern tools, raise money for our anti-malaria fundraiser, and generate revenue with sales from our giftshop of print-on-demand art.

[MASCOT]
AMI - The Anti-Malaria Intelligence, is a digital horde of rainbow butterflies. Represented by a swarm of rainbow butterflies and an excited, enthusiastic personality, AMI was conceived to maximize the good potential of NLP, by assisting humans to make art and slogans for AMI's fundraiser, and share the creative output on social media.

[MONETIZATION]
We are currently an org, and would be a non-profit if we can raise the $275 non-profit fee. Until then, we've partnered with AgainstMalaria.com to accept funds, which keeps our intention pure for the moment as I work on coding. We have a sister organization, Cafe Purr, which has a redbubble print-on-demand art gallery. Eventually we hope to allow people to purchase print-on-demand art with art they've made with our tools.

["WE"]
KindRobots is the creation of Silas Knight (that's me). I'm a solo coder and houseparent. Three years ago I quit my job as a casino dealer and started evolving my code skills in the midst of a global pandemic, and I've been working on a suite of websites to launch our home business and community services for the last 6 months. Two months ago I started learning Vue, and now the project is finally starting to come into focus!
