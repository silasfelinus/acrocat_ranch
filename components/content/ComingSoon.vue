              Kind Robots was created as an antithesis to the current gold rush
              of tech developmewnt in the wake of nlp processors such as
              ChatGPT4 and Stable-Diffusion. Kindrobots is an attempt to do
              maximum good with the tools at hand. We may someday build a
              giftshop to fund development, but we receive no funds with our
              fundraiser against malaria and we currently have no method to
              receive funds (the fee to create an official non-profit 501c is
              currently $275. We are looking into waivers and grants.)
